# **MAGD150_Assignment**

### **LAB 1**
The lab 1 assignment was a **_2D_** image using **_grayscale_** **only** with a _space_ theme using **line,point,rect,and ellipse** .

### **LAB 2**
The lab 2 assignment was the **first** assignment in which we used color. **Both** _RGB_ **and** _HSB_.

### **LAB 3**
Lab 3 was my **first** atempt at using _mouseX_ **and** _mouseY_ coordinates. Also changing the **frame rate**.
Where ever your mouse goes it **draws** bubbles along the way. 

### **LAB 4**
For lab 4 I was experimenting with the **_mousePressed_** _and_ **keyPressed** commands.
If the ellipse is **red** the ball will **not** fall when key is pressed but **will** if ball is **green**.

### **LAB 5**
Lab 5 was my **first** attempt at creating _buttons_.
When mouse is pressed over the **red** button it reveals the entrance to **_hell_** and if mouse is 
pressed over the **white** button it reveals the gate to **_heaven_**.
